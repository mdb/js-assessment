# A test-driven JS assessment

This repository contains my solutions to Rebecca Murphey's
[js-assessment](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment), "a set
of tests that can be used to assess the skills of a candidate for a
JavaScript position, or to improve one's own skills."

The tests are written in [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) and
[expect.js](https://github.com/LearnBoost/expect.js).

## I want to create my own solutions to the tests; what do I do?
Clone Rebecca Murphey's [js-assessment](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment)
and follow the instructions outlined in her README.
